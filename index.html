			<h2>The Dark Knight Triology</h2>
			<p>
				The Dark Knight Series is a set of three Christopher Nolan Batman movies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It includes 
				<ul>
					<li>Batman Begins (2005)</li>
					<li>The Dark Knight (2008)</li>
					<li>The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</li>
				</ul><br>
				Strarring :-<br>
				Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Cillian Murphy appeared in all three movies. The Trilogy is considered by many to be one of the best of all time. Batman's grounded portrayal was universally acclaimed
			</p>
			<h2>Bruce Wayne</h2>
			<p>
				Bruce Wayne, also known by his vigilante persona Batman, is a fictional character who is the main protagonist in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy of superhero films, based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. Portrayed by Christian Bale, this version of Batman is arguably explored more in-depth compared to that of the previous film series by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher, as the Dark Knight film series provides a full arc for the character and was intended by Nolan to be more realistic than previous portrayals.
			</p>
			<p>	
				In the films, Bruce is the billionaire CEO of Wayne Enterprises, specializing in military defense. After witnessing the murder of his parents at age 8, Bruce travels the world in order to train to fight crime, returning to claim inheritance of his father's company. Subsequently, he begins fighting crime in Gotham City as Batman, utilizing advanced technology in doing so and basing his persona on conquering his fear of bats.
			</p>
			<p>	
                Bale's portrayal of Batman has often been considered one of the greatest of the character in film, and has also been credited with the success of the Dark Knight film series, with the latter two films both grossing over $1 billion each, and thus, the restoration of public interest in Batman in the 21st Century.
